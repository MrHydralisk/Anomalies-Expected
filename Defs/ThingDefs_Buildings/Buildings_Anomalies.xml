						<text>Enhanced Cognitive Function Following Non-Standard Sleep\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations of Subject {PAWN_nameDef} following a period of sleep on ordinary bed. This deviated from the typical sleep protocol within the facility. While Subject exhibited abnormally rapid sleep and atypical brain activity, no adverse effects were noted. Interestingly, upon awakening, {PAWN_nameDef} reported newfound knowledge directly related to ongoing anomalies research in the facility. This information appears unrelated to prior exposure within the facility, suggesting unconventional pathways to data acquisition. Current research protocols may not be optimally suited to study this phenomenon. Further investigation is warranted.\n\nObservations:\n{PAWN_nameDef} was permitted to utilize ordinary bed for sleep, deviating from the standard protocol.\nSleep duration was significantly shorter than the norm for Subject.\nBrainwave patterns deviated from baseline readings during sleep.\nNo negative physical or behavioral changes were observed post-sleep.\n\nOutcome:\nUpon awakening, {PAWN_nameDef} reported novel information relevant to ongoing research on anomalies in the facility.\nThe reported information was not previously known to Subject and could not be attributed to standard briefings or exposure within the facility.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest a potential correlation between non-standard sleep and enhanced cognitive function, specifically related to anomaly research. Conventional research methods may not be sufficient to explore this phenomenon.\nTemporary anomalous bed has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation is required to substantiate these observations. Additional tests with {PAWN_nameDef} and potentially other subjects are recommended to explore the potential of non-standard sleep and acquisition of research-relevant data.</text>

						<text>Potential Correlation with Fatigue of Colonists\n\nAbstract:\nThis report details observations concerning the effects of ordinary bed introduced into a research facility housing colonists. Following its arrival, a significant portion of the colonists exhibited increased fatigue. Notably, the severity of fatigue appeared to correlate directly with the frequency of experiments conducted utilizing the ordinary bed. These findings suggest a potential link between the ordinary bed and colonists well-being. Given this observation, continued experimentation with the ordinary bed is recommended with caution. Further investigation into the bed's properties and its impact on colonists' physiology is warranted.\n\nObservations:\nFollowing the introduction of ordinary bed into the facility, a notable increase in fatigue was observed amongst several colonists.\nThe severity of fatigue appears to be directly proportional to the number of experiments conducted utilizing the ordinary bed.\n\nDiscussion:\nThese findings suggest a potential link between the ordinary bed and the colonists fatigue. The observed correlation between experiment frequency and fatigue intensity warrants further investigation.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe data aligns with previous observations regarding Subject's abnormal sleep on ordinary bed. Both instances deviate from the established rest protocols and suggest potential unforeseen consequences associated with standard sleep environments within the facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nGiven the potential detrimental effects, continued experimentation with the ordinary bed should be undertaken with caution. Further analysis of the ordinary bed's properties and its impact on colonists physiology is recommended.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Ordinary Bed and Enhanced Cognitive Function\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report presents a novel theory proposed by Subject {PAWN_nameDef} regarding ordinary bed introduced into a research facility. Subject suggests the bed interacts with the brain neurons of nearby colonists, facilitating enhanced information processing capacity within the sleeper and leading to faster sleep recovery. This theory is based on data obtained during an anomalous sleep event involving Subject and ordinary bed. As a result of this event, the anomaly associated with the bed has been classified as Safe. Report concludes by outlining two primary options for moving forward: termination of the experiment by destruction of the ordinary bed, or continued use under controlled conditions for potential gain of research information.\n\nHypothesis:\nFollowing their non-standard sleep experience, {PAWN_nameDef} has proposed a theory concerning the ordinary bed. Subject suggest the bed utilizes the brain neurons of colonists in its vicinity. This interaction, according to {PAWN_nameDef}, facilitates increased information processing capacity within the sleeper.\n\nDiscussion:\n{PAWN_nameDef}'s theory posits that by leveraging the colonists' collective neural network, the ordinary bed reduces the cognitive load on the sleeper's individual brain. This, in turn, would explain the observed rapid sleep recovery in Subject's case.\nBased on information gleaned during this anomalous sleep event, {PAWN_nameDef} has successfully classified the anomaly associated with the ordinary bed as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nThe potential validity of Subject's theory requires further investigation. Additionally, a critical decision must be made regarding the ordinary bed. Reclassification not required.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: Given the potential for unforeseen consequences related to the standard bed's influence on colonists' neural activity, its destruction may be the most prudent course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if Subject's theory regarding information processing holds merit, continued use of the standard bed, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer significant advantages in anomaly research. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>Unexpected Shift in Anomalous Healing Properties\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nInitial success with an anomalous hospital bed showcasing rapid healing turned problematic in a follow-up experiment. Subject immersion in the crimson fluid, previously observed to heal injuries, resulted in no positive change and instead inflicted new minor wounds. The bed's accompanying medical clipboard displayed altered data. While further knowledge was gained regarding the anomaly, this unexpected outcome necessitates a reevaluation of its functionality and a heightened safety protocol. The anomalous hospital bed has been reclassified as a Class-1 (Caution) anomaly due to its potential to inflict harm. Further experimentation is crucial to understand the cause of this shift in behavior.\n\nObservations:\nOne row was filled with small score on a medical clipboard.\nSubject requires some medical assistance.\n[REDACTED] instructed to lie down on a hospital bed.\nAfter short time a crimson fluid emerged from the bed frame, engulfing the Subject entirely.\nSubject's stress levels increased.\nFollowing another brief interval, the fluid was entirely absorbed back into the bed frame, uncovering Subject.\n[REDACTED] displayed signs of panic and examined its body.\nText changed on a medical clipboard.\n\nOutcome:\nAll previously documented injuries of the Subject remained unhealed.\n[REDACTED] manifested new superficial cuts and minor injuries on its body.\nRow with a score dissapeared on a medical clipboard. No additional row about [REDACTED] wasn't added.\nStudy knowledge was produced during this experiment surpassing that of the previous experiment.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe unexpected results of this experiment necessitate reevaluation of our understanding of this anomaly.\nReclassified anomalous hospital bed as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nIt is crucial to note that the anomaly, unlike previously observed behavior, now demonstrates the potential to inflict harm. This poses a significant threat to the safety of colonists.\n\nRecommendations:\nGiven the potential detrimental effects, continued experimentation with the hospital bed should be undertaken with caution.\nFurther experimentation with injured subjects is required to determine the cause of such change of behaviour.</text>

						<text>Anomalous Bed Reveals Lethal Potential\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nA seemingly healthy [REDACTED] subjected to an anomalous hospital bed resulted in a catastrophic outcome. The hospital bed, previously exhibiting regenerative properties, inflicted significant injuries and tissue loss on the Subject, leading to its demise. The accompanying medical clipboard displayed a decrease in previously high scores, suggesting a potential correlation with the subject's outcome. Experiment highlighted the unpredictable and potentially lethal nature of the anomaly. The hospital bed has been reclassified as a Class-2 (Warning) anomaly. Further experimentation, prioritizing subject safety, is crucial to understand the factors influencing this erratic behavior. Notably, this trial demonstrates the potential use of healthy subjects in future research.\n\nObservations:\nFew rows was filled with big score on a medical clipboard.\nSubject didn't required medical assistance.\n[REDACTED] instructed to lie down on a hospital bed.\nAfter short time a crimson fluid emerged from the bed frame, engulfing the Subject entirely.\nSubject's stress levels escalated rapidly, culminating in audible screams.\nAfter screams stopped, the fluid was entirely absorbed back into the bed frame, uncovering Subject, or rather, what remained.\nTextual data on the medical clipboard changed.\n\nOutcome:\n[REDACTED] manifested significant new injuries and substantial tissue loss.\nSubject [REDACTED] expired due to extensive injuries.\nSeveral high-scoring entries on the medical clipboard disappeared. Remaining entries displayed a decrease in score. No new entry for Subject [REDACTED] was generated.\nStudy knowledge was produced during this experiment surpassing that of the first experiment.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe outcome of this experiment has left researchers profoundly disturbed.\nThis experiment also shows that use of healthy subjects is possible.\nReclassified anomalous hospital bed as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly, due to its demonstrated lethality.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther experimentation with injured subjects is imperative to establish the factors influencing such erratic behavior.</text>

						<text>Anomalous Medical Bed and Clipboard Reveal Interconnected Nature\n\nAbstract:\nThe anomalous hospital bed exhibits a peculiar connection to its accompanying medical clipboard. Attempts to remove the clipboard resulted in its transformation into a liquid and subsequent reintegration with the bed frame. A new clipboard then materialized, replicating the previous one's data. Analysis of past observations suggests the clipboard acts as a log of interactions with the medical bed. New entries appear upon successful healing (accompanied by a score), while filled rows seem to increase the risk of subject injury, with the severity potentially linked to the total score. This revelation emphasizes the importance of scrutinizing the clipboard's information before using the anomalous hospital bed to enhance safety and potentially unlock the key to understanding of its operation.\n\nObservations:\nAn attempt was made to remove the medical clipboard from the bed.\nUpon moving the clipboard more than one meter away from the bed, it transformed into a liquid state and flowed back onto the hospital bed frame.\nMoments later, a new medical clipboard solidified on top of the bed.\n\nOutcome:\nRemoval of the medical clipboard was unsuccessful.\nThe newly formed clipboard displayed a copy of the previous clipboard's data.\n\nDiscussion:\nConsidering all previous changes in text on a medical clipboard it should be safe to assume that it provides information related to operation that will happen with subject on a medical bed.\nWhen a subject is successfully healed, a new row appears on the clipboard with a corresponding score. This score likely reflects the amount of regeneration that occurred.\nConversely, when rows on the clipboard are not empty, there is a possibility of the subject sustaining injuries. The severity of these injuries seems to correlate with the sum of the scores on the clipboard.\n\nConsiderations:\nAn observer has identified a potential pattern: the likelihood of a subject experiencing injury from the hospital bed appears to be directly related to the percentage of filled rows on the medical clipboard.\n\nRecommendations:\nIt is imperative to pay close attention to the information displayed on the medical clipboard before utilizing the medical bed on a subject. This information may hold the key to safely operating the anomaly.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Anomalous Medical Bed\n\nAbstract:\nThis report presents a novel theory proposed by one of observers of anomalous medical bed regarding it functionality. Anomaly was labeled as Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit (ECRU). It suggested that ECRU function by utilizing a regenerative crimson liquid stored within its frame. Analysis suggests this liquid repairs human tissue, but requires refilling. The accompanying clipboard may track depletion and indicate refill urgency. A disturbing theory proposes the ECRU consumes tissues of some subject's for refilling, potentially fatally. Research aims to replicate the liquid for safer medical use. The report recommends either destroying the ECRU or implementing strict protocols for controlled use.\n\nHypothesis:\nAn observer, drawing upon observations from all experiments and information gleaned from surviving subjects, has proposed a theory concerning the Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit functionality. The ECRU frame likely houses a reservoir containing a regenerative crimson liquid that stimulates human tissue repair. The accompanying medical clipboard potentially tracks the liquid's depletion and indicates the urgency of refilling. When a refill is necessary, next subject's tissues will be consumed to produce liquid. The outcome for the subject depends on the volume required, with a potential risk of fatality. A portion of the liquid might be used to maintain the functionality of the organic metal frame.\n\nDiscussion:\nWe might be able to use this knowledge to replicate production of this liquid of lower concentration for usage between colonists.\nAnomalous medical bed was renamed to Emergency Cellular Restoration Unit.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: Given the potential for accidental death on this medical bed, its destruction may be the most prudent course of action.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if hypothesis is right, then continued use of ECRU, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer significant advantages in medical care. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>Analysis of an Automated Meat Grinder\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nAn industrial-looking metal box functioned as an automated meat grinder. Upon activation, it collected nearby corpses, processed them into fist-sized meat and leather chunks, and deactivated after butchering all available corpses. Processed materials exhibited no anomalous properties. The meat grinder's lack of apparent power source warrants further investigation. Classified as Class-0 (Safe).\n\nObservations:\nDeceased animal specimens were placed in proximity to the industrial-looking metal box. {PAWN_nameDef} was instructed to press the button. Upon activation, small access doors on the sides automatically opened. A thin, metallic manipulator arms emerged from the access door and deposited corpse into a central processing chamber. Subject reported of hearing sounds of corpse being cut and crushed. Fist-sized chunks of processed meat and leather were ejected from one of the access doors. After some time, when there was no corpses left around it, it deactivated itself.\n\nOutcome:\nAll deceased animal specimens around metal box were successfully butchered. Analysis of the processed meat and leather revealed no anomalous properties.\n\nDiscussion:\nIndustrial-looking metal box appears to function as an automated meat grinder. Activation via a button triggers the retrieval of corpses, butchering, and expulsion of processed materials. It doesn't seems to require any power input, reason of which requires further investigation.\nTemporary meat grinder has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther observation is required to explore it other possible anomalous effects.</text>

						<text>Unveiling the Sound-Efficiency Link\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nPreviously safe meat grinder exhibited aggressive behavior during routine testing. A weak, previously unnoticed sound correlated with reaction from manipulator that injured personnel. Butchering efficiency appears to be linked to the sound, with higher sound levels leading to increased output. The anomaly has been reclassified as Class-1 (Caution) due to safety concerns. Further investigation is required to understand the sound's role and prevent future incidents.\n\nObservations:\nA weak sound was reported emanating from the meat grinder. Standard experiment procedures were initiated. Upon activation attempt, an access door opened unexpectedly, and a manipulator arm pushed [REDACTED] towards the processing chamber. Subject experienced increased stress and sustained a bleeding hand injury. Meat grinder continued its processing function as observed in previous experiments. The weak sound reportedly disappeared after a few corpses were butchered.\n\nOutcome:\n[REDACTED] lost a finger due to the incident.\nMaximum sound level measured 40 dB.\nThe amount of processed meat and leather increased compared to previous experiments that lacked the sound.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe potential for harm appears linked to the previously unnoticed weak sound emanating from the meat grinder. The sound level might influence the efficiency of the butchering process. Sound level decrease with amount of corpses processed by the meat grinder.\nReclassified meat grinder as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nConsiderations:\nThis incident highlights a significant shift in the anomaly's behavior compared to earlier observations. Its potential to cause harm poses a serious threat to personnel safety.\n\nRecommendations:\nFurther observation is crucial to understand the sound's role in the process.</text>

						<text>Sound as a Predictor of Injury\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nExperiments revealed a concerning link between sound level and injury risk during activation of an anomalous meat grinder. Higher sound levels (0 dB = safe, 90 dB = critical limb loss) correlated with increased injury severity. The grinder's sound level appears to rise over time, suggesting potentially even greater dangers. Notably, processing human corpses seems to temporarily reduce the sound similar to using multiple animal specimens. Extreme caution and sound monitoring are crucial before activation.\n\nObservations:\nMultiple experiments were conducted, with a focus on recording sound levels during operation.\n\nOutcome:\nA clear correlation was observed between sound level and the severity of injuries sustained by [REDACTED] during activation attempts:\n- 0 dB = Safe\n- 40 dB = Finger loss\n- 60 dB = Hand or Foot loss\n- 90 dB = Leg or Arm loss\n\nDiscussion:\nHigher sound levels appear to correlate with a greater risk of the subject being drawn into the processing chamber and sustaining severe injuries. The sound level generated by the meat grinder seems to rise over time, suggesting a potential for even higher sound levels (beyond the observed 90 dB).\nInterestingly, processing human corpses appears to temporarily reduce the sound level similar to using multiple similar animal corpses.\n\nRecommendations:\nExtreme caution is advised before activating the meat grinder. Personnel should prioritize monitoring sound levels during operation.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Meat Grinder\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nDrilling into the anomalous Symphony of Eternal Slaughter revealed human organs and a brain sustained by an organic-metallic life support system. Scans matched the internal sounds with humming reported during a prior unauthorized access lethal incident. A hypothesis proposes a dissected person inside psychically attracts and consumes others for self-preservation, with stress levels impacting processing efficiency. Distraction may disrupt control. Destruction is recommended due to safety concerns, though controlled use offers potential benefits if risks are mitigated.\n\nObservations:\n[REDACTED] utilized drilling equipment to create an opening in one of the meat grinder's access doors. Following the initial drilling, blood was observed leaking from the interior of the machine. [REDACTED] reported hearing a heartbeat and witnessing muscle contractions within the meat grinder.\nScans were conducted through the newly created opening, revealing the presence of human organs and a brain inside.\n\nOutcome:\nThe scans revealed human organs, including a brain, located within the organic metal core of the meat grinder. These organs appear to be maintained by a life support system constructed from a network of twisted flesh.\nAdditional sound analysis revealed similarities between the detected sounds and the humming reported by [REDACTED] during the unauthorized access incident.\n\nHypothesis:\nBased on the report by [REDACTED], the following theory regarding the Symphony of Eternal Slaughter is proposed by one of observers. A dissected human is contained within the organic metal core of the machine, with their organs and brain kept functional through a life support system. This potentially reflects an unorthodox method, employed by archotech scientists, to automate the butchering process without rellying on artificial intelligence. To maintain itself, this person might utilize a form of singing on psychic level to attract living humans. Consumed alive humans or their body parts may be used to sustain the person by providing bodily fluids and cells, allowing for self-sustenance. Increased stress levels within the person could potentially correlate with higher processing efficiency, possibly as a means of attracting attention and ensure flow of corpses and bodies.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt is theorized that effective distraction of a subject affected by the singing could potentially disrupt control of the meat grinder and prevent a lethal incident.\n\nRecommendations:\nRemoval: Given the potential for accidental death, it destruction maybe the best coarse of action. This approach could also potentially provide access to samples of meat grinder person's body parts from it.\nControlled Use: Alternatively, if hypothesis is right, then continued use of meat grinder, under controlled and monitored conditions, could offer substantial benefits in terms of corpse butchering. This approach, however, necessitates thorough risk assessment and the development of safety protocols to safeguard colonists' well-being.</text>

						<text>Teleportation and High-Energy Beam\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nAnomalous transmitter breached containment via teleportation after receiving unknown data. Subsequent high-intensity energy beam attack caused extensive environmental damage. Transmitter recovered undamaged. Transmitter's self-teleportation and data link to destructive potential necessitate Class-2 (Warning) classification. Continuous monitoring and relocation protocols are crucial to mitigate future threats.\n\nObservations:\nSecurity footage captured the appearance of a countdown timer on the digital dial of transmitter, after which it teleported out of its containment area, with only one indicator lamp illuminated.\nA separate camera recorded the transmitter's reappearance outside the facility.\nFollowing the countdown completion, security personnel [REDACTED] within the facility reported a sudden increase in ambient light, resembling high noon, despite recorded footage indicating it was nighttime.\nCamera footage confirmed a high-intensity energy beam originating from the sky, incinerating a large area encompassing local flora and fauna.\nThe beam dissipated after approximately one hour, leaving the transmitter unscathed on the ground.\n\nOutcome:\nNo personnel, including [REDACTED], were injured during the incident due to the transmitter's prior teleportation. However, extensive environmental damage occurred within the affected area.\nThe number of illuminated indicator lamps on the transmitter changed after retrieval and relocation to the containment area. No physical damage was observed.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis dangerous incident underscores the significant danger posed by transmitter. The continuous data exchange with an unknown source appears strongly linked to the high-energy beam attack.\nWhile the beam appears to target the transmitter location upon countdown completion, this could be exploited for damage mitigation by relocating it to a nearby uninhabited area.\nUnfortunately, the transmitter self-teleportation ability renders this strategy unreliable.\nThe extent of the transmitter teleportation range is unknown, necessitating preparedness for potential teleportation within the facility.\nReclassified transmitter as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly, due to the demonstrated destructive capabilities.\n\nRecommendations:\nMeticulous monitoring of both the transmitter physical location and the displayed time on the digital dial is essential to prevent the energy beam from impacting the facility's interior.\nIn the event of an internal teleportation, immediate intervention is advised, involving personnel retrieving the transmitter and relocating it outside vital areas.</text>

						<text>Multiple Beams and Timer Delay\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nAnomaly transmitter breached containment and teleported within the facility. Relocation efforts revealed a critical detail: holding a button on the base extends the initial countdown and triggers a short secondary timer upon release. The anomaly fires multiple beams based on indicator lights, with the first targeting itself and subsequent beams hitting random nearby locations. This significantly increases potential damage. Anomaly reclassified as Class-4 (Critical). Stricter surveillance and mandatory button holding during emergency relocation are recommended.\n\nObservations:\nSecurity footage captured the teleportation of transmitter with three indicator lights illuminated. It materialized within the facility's storage room, in proximity to [REDACTED].\nFollowing established protocol, Subject retrieved the transmitter despite encountering resistance from its retractable stops. [REDACTED] then left facility with the transmitter in hands. The digital dial displayed a 2 hour countdown timer.\nAfter exceeding the 2 hour mark, Subject relocated the transmitter to a deserted area before departing at high speed. Long-range camera footage confirmed the subsequent activation of three high-energy beams impacting the area where the transmitter was previously located.\n\nOutcome:\nDuring post-incident questioning regarding continued movement beyond the 2 hour countdown, [REDACTED] revealed that upon releasing the transmitter, the digital dial was displaying a remaining 12-minute timer. Additionally, unintentional activation of a small button on the transmitter base was reported.\nPost-event analysis confirmed 2 out of the 3 energy beams struck locations slightly away from the transmitter spot, evident by 3 distinct, overlapping scorched circles on the ground.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis incident suggests a method to manipulate the initial countdown timer. Continuous pressure applied to a button located on the base of transmitter seemingly extends the two-hour window, providing additional time for relocation. It appears the initial countdown serves as a buffer period unless the button is activated. Once released, a 12-minute timer initiates, prompting personnel to evacuate the immediate vicinity.\nFurthermore, the number of illuminated indicator lights appears directly proportional to the quantity of energy beams fired. While the first beam targets the transmitter location, subsequent beams seem to strike random targets within a short radius around it. This significantly increases the potential area of effect and raises concerns about possible undetected activations within the facility itself.\nReclassified transmitter as Class-4 (Critical) anomaly, due to the enhanced destructive capabilities and the potential for wide range damage to facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nSurveillance of transmitter must be prioritized and elevated to the highest level.\nThe containment protocol should be amended to mandate the continuous pressing of the button located on the base of the transmitter during emergency relocation procedures.</text>

						<text>Manual Activation and Combat Application\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nTesting transmitter revealed a manual activation method via its base button. Holding the button halts the countdown timer, but accidental release triggers a 12-minute countdown to self-activation. The incident highlights the dangers of transporting the transmitter and the potential for weaponized use. Updated protocols will consider combat applications, while emphasizing safety measures.\n\nObservations:\nTransmitter was transported to a designated outdoor testing area for further experimentation.\nDuring initial interaction, [REDACTED] attempted to activate the button located on the base of the transmitter while the digital timer was inactive.\nThis action unexpectedly initiated a 12-minute countdown on the digital dial.\nSubject then retrieved the transmitter and maintained pressure on the button, successfully halting the countdown timer at 12 minutes.\nWhile attempting to transport the transmitter to a designated location for a controlled attack test, [REDACTED] tripped, causing her leg to become lodged in a crevice in the ground.\nThe transmitter fell from Subject's grasp and landed at a distance beyond immediate reach.\nUpon landing, transmitter's pneumatic retractable stops deployed, preventing retrieval attempts using a nearby stick.\nAs the 12-minute timer expired, a high-intensity energy beam struck the transmitter location, consistent with previous observations.\n\nOutcome:\nTragically, [REDACTED] succumbed to the effects of the energy beam at the incident location, with only residual ash recovered.\n\nDiscussion:\nThis unforeseen event, while being tragic, provided valuable insights into the transmitter functionality.\nThe experiment inadvertently revealed a method for manual activation through interaction with the button. This opens potential avenues for controlled applications in combat scenarios.\nThe incident also highlighted the inherent risks associated with transporting the transmitter, even in a activating state. Accidental release of a button can trigger the countdown timer, posing a serious threat to the carrier, if they stay nearby.\nFurthermore, the activation of the pneumatic retractable stops upon landing suggests internal sensors that detect solid ground, which makes retrieval after accidental release more challenging.\n\nRecommendations:\nThe established protocols for transmitter should be amended to include authorization for its controlled use in combat situations. However, the inherent risks associated with such deployment must be carefully considered and addressed through thorough training and safety protocols.</text>

The OBTT exhibits concerning modifications: self-repair via organic material and teleportation based on satellite data (prioritizing buildings). While potentially repurposable as a weapon, its critical classification remains due to safety risks and teleportation capabilities. Removal or controlled use require careful consideration due to inherent risks.\n\nHypothesis:\nBased on observations from all experiments and data from transmission, a theory regarding the Orbital Beam Training Target (OBTT) origin and behavior was proposed.\nOBTT was build by archotech engineers to test and coordinate network of multiple power-collection satellites. Lit lamps on the indicator represent the amount of satellites it was able to connect. While digital dial represent time it takes for satellites to aim at the OBTT as the target. Additional safety feature was installed in it as button at the bottom, which allowed ground personal to delay attack to evacuate firing zone. Strong pneumatic retractable stops was installed to keep OBTT in one place during beam effect. While it was made of military grade composite to withstand multiple usage, it appears to have undergone alterations. Seems like organic metal infestated the device making it to regenerate any damage from beam. Additionally it acquired ability to self-teleport. Target of teleportation selected via processing of big amount of recieved data from satellite imaging, to prioritize building as targets. Due to the interference in the atmosphere satellite imaging not always available, making it pick random spot nearby to teleport to. Since it was made for military practice it doesn't risk being permamently deactivated by the satellites, but still require some time (~5 days) between manual activation.\n\nDiscussion:\nBased on our current understanding of the OBTT, it has the potential to be repurposed as a powerful military-grade tool. Additionally, its self-teleportation ability requires a high level of surveillance capability for preventive measures against activation in vital facility zones.\nThe current classification of the OBTT remains Class-4 (Critical) as it still pose an immediate threat to the facility and it personal, even with current safety protocols.\n\nRecommendations:\nRemoval: Given the potential for it indestructability, destruction is impossible but it can be send to the other part of the world. The OBTT teleportation abilities still present a risk of it returning to the facility one day.\nControlled Use: If the hypothesis holds true, continued utilization of the OBTT under controlled and monitored conditions could offer a sustainable fire power for the facility defense. This approach, however, requires thorough risk assessment and robust safety protocols to prevent it activation in vital zones.</text>

						<text>Liquid Analysis\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nA strange puddle exhibiting anomalous properties was discovered. The substance within resembled blood, but had color of a significantly lower oxygen concentration. As sampling depth increased, the liquid's density grew, reaching a point of impenetrability at one meter. Analysis revealed a composition primarily composed of blood with a bioferrite admixture. Given its non-hostile nature and unique density-shifting properties, the puddle has been temporarily classified as a Class-0 (Safe) anomaly. Further investigation is recommended to fully understand its potential applications and anomalous characteristics.\n\nObservations:\nUpon examination of the strange puddle, {PAWN_nameDef} observed that the substance within resembled blood, though with a notably low oxygen concentration.\nMultiple test tubes were filled with samples extracted from various depths.\n{PAWN_nameDef} reported a significant increase in liquid density at greater depths, making extraction increasingly difficult.\n\nOutcome:\nThroughout the sampling process, puddle displayed no hostile reaction.\nAnalysis of the collected samples revealed a composition approximately 90% identical to standard blood, with the addition of bioferrite.\nAt a depth of 1 meter, the liquid's density became too high to permit further extraction.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe blood-like liquid in the strange puddle appears to possess the ability to dynamically adjust its density, with increasing depth correlating to higher density.\nThis unique property suggests the potential for bioferrite separation from blood-like liquid.\nGiven the lack of hostile behavior, puddle has been temporary classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued monitoring of the puddle is recommended to further investigate its anomalous properties and explore potential applications.</text>

						<text>Continuation of the Study is Not Possible\n\nAbstract:\nA hazardous blood-like puddle was observed to exhibit anomalous properties, including the emergence of fleshbeasts. Attempts to investigate and contain the puddle were hindered by its unique characteristics, such as rapid density fluctuations. The puddle's classification has been elevated to Class-2 (Warning) due to the potential threat posed by the fleshbeasts. Further research is not possible, but development of containment and extraction methods, is necessary to utilize this anomaly.\n\nObservations:\nA series of measurements were recorded during and subsequent to the emergence of fleshbeasts from the puddle.\nAttempts to excavate beneath the puddle to identify the source of the creatures were unsuccessful.\nSimilarly, efforts to fill the puddle with soil proved ineffective.\n\nOutcome:\nThe lowest recorded density of the blood-like liquid was observed during the emergence of the fleshbeasts, reaching a value of 1060 kg/m³.\nFollowing the encounter, the liquid's density rapidly increased.\nExcavation attempts revealed that the puddle's external dimensions significantly underestimated its internal depth. The puddle's external appearance was misleading, as its depth was much greater than its surface area.\nFurthermore, any soil introduced into the puddle was pushed outward by the blood-like liquid.\n\nDiscussion:\nWhile the number of emerging fleshbeasts did not pose an immediate threat to the facility, individual colonists working nearby could be at risk during future emergence events.\nObserved correlation between density and time till fleshbeasts emergence:\n13590 kg/m3 = 2 days\n3120 kg/m3 = 1 day\n1839 kg/m3 = 8 hours\n1060 kg/m3 = 1 hour\nThe small size of the puddle results in rapid density increases after fleshbeast emergence, hindering further exploration.\nOur scientists have developed a dissolvent chemicals capable of counteracting the increasing surface density, allowing us to fill it with soil.\nReclassified puddle as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly.\n\nHypothesis:\n{PAWN_nameDef} proposed a theory suggesting a connection between the puddle and a blood-like liquid source in a different plain of reality. The puddle may be analogous to a cut in arteriole, which transporting blood-like liquid. Fleshbeasts may reside within this source and utilize the arterioles for movement. The rapid density increase near exits could be a defensive mechanism, similar to blood coagulation. Unfortunately, the small size of the arterioles prevents human exploration.\n\nRecommendations:\nRemoval: The use of dissolvent chemicals and soil filling is recommended to eliminate the threat within the facility's territory.\nControlled Use: A controlled collection system, utilizing a blood-like liquid pump, is suggested for potential future applications.\nSecurity: Additional security units should be deployed to respond to future fleshbeast emergence events.</text>

						<text>Liquid Analysis\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nA large, anomalous blood-like lake has been discovered, exhibiting similar characteristics to a previously encountered blood puddle anomaly. The lake contains a blood-like substance with a bioferrite admixture and poses a potential threat due to the emergence of fleshbeasts. Despite the increased size and depth, the lake remains a hazardous environment requiring careful monitoring and security measures. Further research is necessary to understand its origins, potential applications, and the nature of the fleshbeast threat.\n\nObservations:\nUpon examination of the strange lake, {PAWN_nameDef} observed that the substance within resembled blood, though with a notably low oxygen concentration.\nMultiple test tubes were filled with samples extracted from various depths.\n{PAWN_nameDef} reported a significant increase in liquid density at greater depths, making extraction increasingly difficult.\nThe Subject noted similarities between this lake and the previously studied blood puddle anomaly.\n\nOutcome:\nDuring the sampling process, lake displayed no hostile reaction. However, the sampling device sustained multiple bite marks.\nAnalysis of the collected samples revealed a composition approximately 90% identical to standard blood, with the addition of bioferrite.\nAt a depth of 10 meter, the liquid's density became too high to permit further extraction.\n\nDiscussion:\nComparative analysis of the blood-like liquid from the lake and archived samples from the blood puddle anomaly yielded a 100% match.\nThis, coupled with the damage to the sampling device, suggests a strong connection between the two anomalies. This connection implies that some fleshbeasts may be capable of reaching the surface, even under high-density conditions.\nThe larger size of the lake offers a greater potential for blood-like liquid extraction.\nTemporary strange lake has been classified as Class-2 (Warning) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Continued monitoring of the lake is recommended to further investigate its anomalous properties and explore potential applications.\nSecurity: Additional security units should be deployed to respond to potential fleshbeast emergence events.</text>

						<text>Outcome of Encounter\n\nAbstract:\nA significant change in the anomalous blood lake has been observed, with a decrease in the high-density region. This development suggests a potential increase in the threat level, as it may facilitate the emergence of a larger number of fleshbeasts. The lake's classification has been elevated to Class-4 (Critical) to reflect this heightened risk. Further investigation, including the deployment of underwater drones, is necessary to understand the source and nature of the fleshbeast threat.\n\nOutcome:\nPost-encounter, depth sensors indicated that the high-density region at the 50-meter depth was no longer detectable.\n\nDiscussion:\nIt is possible that a significant number of fleshbeasts have passed through the high-density region, leading to its depletion.\nThis development may allow for deeper exploration of the lake.\nTo better understand the origin of the fleshbeasts, deploying an underwater drone is recommended.\nGiven the significant threat posed by potential fleshbeast emergences, the lake's classification has been elevated to Class-4 (Critical) anomaly.\n\nHypothesis:\n{PAWN_nameDef} proposed a theory building upon the existing blood puddle hypothesis. While puddle can be compared to an arteriole of blood-like liquid system, the Lake can be compared to an aorta. Due to its larger size, the lake exhibits reduced coagulation properties and increased blood-like liquid flow capacity, enabling the passage of larger groups of fleshbeasts. This increased size may also allow for human exploration.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Deploying an underwater drone is recommended to investigate the source of the fleshbeasts.\nSecurity: Preparation for potential large-scale fleshbeast emergences in the future is crucial.</text>

						<text>Drone Usage Result\n\nSubject: Underwater drone\n\nAbstract:\nA daring underwater exploration of the blood lake has yielded surprising results. A remote-operated drone successfully penetrated the depths, encountering hostile lifeforms and unusual environmental conditions. The discovery of a breathable air pocket on the other side of the lake suggests a potential path for human exploration. However, the presence of aggressive creatures and the unknown nature of the deeper regions necessitate careful planning and preparation for future expedition.\n\nObservations:\nAn underwater drone was deployed into the blood-like liquid. The drone’s primary functions were tested and confirmed operational.\nAs the drone descended, it passed the 50-meter depth mark, encountering and avoiding several small fleshbeasts.\nAt the 100-meter depth, the drone was briefly attacked by medium-sized fleshbeasts, but the attack caused minimal damage.\nThe drone continued its descent, reaching a depth of 250 meters, where a minor malfunction occurred in the orientation system.\nAt 400 meters, a small fleshbeast attached itself to the drone, puncturing its outer shell. Surprisingly, the drone did not experience the expected pressure-related damage at this depth.\nThe drone reached a depth of 450 meters, but a power source issue, likely caused by the previous attack, limited its operational range to approximately 70 meters.\nAt the 500-meter mark, the drone unexpectedly surfaced.\nA scan of the surrounding area revealed an air pocket suitable for human respiration. The drone's lidar system, limited in range, provided a partial scan of the area, which appeared dimly lit.\nBefore communication was lost, the drone detected signs of moving heat signatures approaching its position.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe emergence of the drone suggests the existence of a surface area on the opposite side of the blood lake. The nature of this area, whether open or enclosed, remains uncertain.\nHowever, the lack of pressure-related damage to the drone at extreme depths indicates that the blood-like liquid's density is not directly correlated with depth.\nThe presence of breathable air on the other side suggests potential for human exploration without additional protective gear.\nThe final moments of the drone's transmission indicate the presence of potential threats in the area.\n\nRecommendations:\nExpedition: A manned expedition should be organized to explore the other side of the blood lake. The team should be adequately equipped and prepared for potential fleshbeasts threats.\nDevelopment: The development of more durable and resilient armor plating for underwater exploration is recommended.</text>

						<text>Expedition\n\nAbstract:\nA daring expedition into the depths of the blood lake has led to the discovery of a strange, fleshmass-infested world. The exploration team encountered hostile environments, including gravitational anomalies and aggressive fleshbeasts. Despite these challenges, the team successfully breached the high-density region and emerged into an unknown landscape. Further exploration and research are necessary to understand the nature of this alien world and the potential threats it poses.\n\nObservations:\nAn exploration team, consisting of [REDACTED], entered an experimental submarine equipped to penetrate the high-density regions of the blood lake.\nThe submarine was successfully deployed and its primary functions tested.\nThe team began their descent, reaching a depth of 150 meters. The reinforced submarine hull proved effective in defending against multiple attacks from small fleshbeasts.\nAt 250 meters, the team experienced a sudden shift in gravity, leading to minor injuries. The submarine's orientation system automatically adjusted to the new gravitational vector.\nAt 425 meters, a large fleshbeast attacked the submarine, puncturing its hull. The crew was able to quickly seal the breach and deter the creature with an electric pulse.\nThe submarine continued its descent, reaching a depth of 500 meters before surfacing.\nAfter double checking the air, temperature and radiation, exploration team leaving the submarine.\nThe team observed a dim, cloudy sky and a landscape heavily infested with flesh mass and numerous dormant or active fleshbeasts.\nSensors detected a weak signal in the vicinity.\n\nOutcome:\nThe exploration team successfully breached the high-density region of the blood lake and emerged into an unknown, flesmass infected environment.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe discovery of a sky and celstial light source, raises significant questions about the nature of the blood lake.\nThe linear descent of 500 meters suggests a tunnel-like structure, yet the emergence into an open area challenges this assumption.\nThe pervasive fleshmass and the presence of active fleshbeasts indicate a hostile environment.\nThe detected signal, potentially originating from a technological device, offers a tantalizing clue about the history and purpose of this location.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: A comprehensive study of the newly discovered location is necessary to understand its nature, origins, and potential threats. This also may help with finding the source of this signal.\nSecurity: We must establish a defensive perimeter and prepare from potential attacks by fleshbeasts.</text>

						<AnomalyDesc>A dark, viscous giant crimson pool, oozing and spreading, a stark contrast to the surrounding environment. The substance within is a blood-like liquid, composed primarily of blood with a bioferrite admixture. Occasiounally small fleshbeasts will emerge from it.

						<text>The Sacrifice\n\nAbstract:\nCommunication with personnel on the other side of the blood lake has been lost, and the lake's high-density region has returned to its previous state. While the immediate threat of large-scale fleshbeast incursions has diminished, the lake's inherent instability warrants its continued classification as a Class-4 (Critical) anomaly. To mitigate future risks, the complete neutralization of the lake through the use of a dissolvent chemical is recommended. However, controlled extraction of the blood-like liquid for research and technological applications remains a viable option.\n\nOutcome:\nAll communication with personnel on the other side of the blood lake has been lost.\nAdditionally, the high-density region of the lake has returned to a depth of 50 meters.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe apparent closure of the connection to the other side of the blood lake suggests that the threat of large-scale fleshbeast incursions has diminished.\nThe current classification of Blood Lake remains Class-4 (Critical), even though it no longer pose an immediate threat to personnel within the facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nDestruction: The use of the dissolvent chemical, previously employed on the blood puddle, is recommended to permanently eliminate the threat posed by the blood lake.\nControlled Use: Continued extraction of blood-like liquid from the lake remains viable, particularly for applications related to the recently acquired knowledge and technologies.</text>

						<text>Fleshmass response\n\nAbstract:\nAn exploration team encountered a hostile, flesh-infested environment on the other side of the blood lake. The team faced coordinated attacks from fleshbeasts and experienced a sense of déjà vu. Evidence of human infrastructure and a mysterious signal suggest a complex history and potential threat. Further exploration and research are necessary to understand the nature of this world.\n\nObservations:\nThe exploration team encountered a hostile environment dominated by flesh mass.\nThe soil beneath their feet was covered in the fleshmass, and they were subjected to continuous attacks from various directions.\nThe emergence of new fleshbeasts from underground nests suggests a coordinated assault.\nAdditionally, the team experienced long ranged acid spit attacks, further complicating the situation.\nSome team members reported a sense of familiarity with the location, and others discovered dog tags with names resembling their own.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe underground nests, likely of human origin, suggest a pre-existing infrastructure in this location.\nThe coordinated attacks by the fleshbeasts, including the acid spitters, imply a level of intelligence and organization that may be controlled by a hive mind.\nThe detected signal, matching our facility's frequency, but it require more time to find the exact location of transmitter.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: We should continue study blood lake exit to learn more about this location and pinpoint the source of detected signal.\nSecurity: The exploration team must maintain a strong defensive perimeter and be prepared for further attacks from fleshbeasts.</text>

						<text>Strange Coincidence of Blood Lake Exit Location\n\nAbstract:\nAn exploration team ventured into a flesh-infested reality, discovering a familiar yet distorted landscape. The team encountered hostile environments, including flesh-based creatures and a pervasive flesh mass. Despite these challenges, the team successfully located a distress signal matching the facility's own. Further investigation of the signal source is necessary to understand the nature of this parallel reality and its connection to our own.\n\nObservations:\nSome members of the exploration team climbed a nearby mountain to gain a broader perspective of the surrounding terrain.\nThe team observed that the flesh mass infection extended as far as the eye could see.\nA night sky survey was conducted through clear patches in the cloudy sky.\nThe team successfully located the source of the detected signal, which was identified as an automated distress signal identical to those used in our facility.\n\nDiscussion:\nDespite the unfamiliar terrain, celestial observations and GPS data indicate that the team remains on the same planet and in the same general location as the facility.\nHowever, the presence of familiar names on recovered dog tags and the maintenance of communication with our facility suggest a probability of a parallel reality.\nBut what and why happened here? The reasons of this differences between realities remain a mystery.\nSignal source might be our only hope to figure this out.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Prioritize reaching the signal source to gather information about the nature of differences in this reality. This should be main priority of Exploration Team. Information about it location is located on reciever in Blood Lake Exit.\nSecurity: aintain a strong defensive perimeter around the exploration team and ensure their safety during the investigation.</text>

						<text>Fleshmass Experiments\n\nAbstract:\nA mysterious discovery of a control panel within a hidden facility has led to the recovery of crucial documents, including a researcher's diary. The diary details experiments involving a blood-like substance capable of inducing grotesque mutations in living organisms. The recovered data suggests a potential divergence in timelines between our reality and the one from which these artifacts originated. Further investigation of the facility could provide valuable insights into the nature of these difference from our own reality.\n\nObservations:\nA functioning control panel, similar to those used in our facility, was discovered.\nThe last user, [REDACTED], required a password for access.\nThe similarity between this individual's name and that of a member [REDACTED] of our facility prompted usage of their password instead.\nRemarkably, the password matched that of our [REDACTED].\nWhile many files were corrupted, some remained accessible.\n\nDiary #1:\nResearcher [REDACTED]\n[**.**.****] Today, we located a source of blood-like liquid and taking it back to facility for experiments.\n[**.**.****] This substance has shown remarkable properties. When it was accidently spilled on a corpse, it initiated a mutation process. When I added more liquid, at the end of the mutation process corpse flesh mutated into a somewhat of fleshmass cyst. I tried to use this cyst on a another corpse, but to no avail. It maybe can only work with alive subject.\n[**.**.****] Today's subject is an animal of [REDACTED] species. When I tried to apply fleshmass cyst to it, the cyst rejected the body and did not take root.\n[**.**.****] I have tested it on so many animals, both alive and dead, but cyst just doesn't want to take root in them. I can't understand why. Even when I tried to use more liquid on animal corpses, it no longer reacted to create a new cyst. What is different? Why is it no longer working? Wait, the original corpse wasn't of an animal, but of an intruder who broke into our storage facility. What if... I need to get permission to test my theory.\n[**.**.****] Today I was able to gain access to a new subject that we recently captured. It a human [REDACTED] with a collapsed lung. We had no use for him, so they let me use him as a test subject for my theory. It took root! It took root! It began to slowly mutate.\n[**.**.****] I ended up needing to mute the Subject, because he was screaming too much from pain for the whole day. But it was worth it. My theory was right. It mutated into a new lung, if we can even call this fleshmass a lung, but it does the lung's functions, so it should be fine to call it that. I need to make more cysts to test more.\n[**.**.****] This new liquid is wonderful. It can affect human flesh and cause mutations. I have been able to mutate so many organs so far, but cyst doesn't seem to react to some organs. I wonder if we could control the end result of the mutation a bit better, because so far, I need to request new Subjects too often.\n[**.**.****] Today I was able to force-grow a new organ in a Subject's body. It was creating concentrated acid within itself. But I guess I did something wrong, because after a few hours, organ walls weren't able to contain the acid inside and it went into the Subject's body. Pity that I would need to wait for a new Subject to arrive, but at least I was able to measure how long it takes for such acid to melt a person.\n[**.**.****] News about my success at creating replacement organs is starting to spread throughout the facility, finally stopping those nasty rumors about my work. I even got a request from one of my old colleagues to make a replacement organ for their faulty liver. To be honest, they should just drink less.\n[**.**.****] Today, I got permission to fully mutate a Subject. The process wasn't hard due to my experience. But the result was a bit not what I was expecting. The body size was drastically smaller, than the original Subject. Its intellectual capacity was that of some small animal. But it was obedient enough, so I decided to label such a mutation as Fingerspike.\n\nDiscussion:\nA comparison of the restored files with our facility's database revealed potential temporal discrepancies between the two realities. This divergence in time could explain the differences in database dates and the greater depth of the facility's underground structure.\nThe previously observed underground nests appear to be ventilation exits for the facility's subterranean floors.\nThe flesh mass network seems to function as a sensory system, monitoring the movements of intruders within it controlled territory. Similar to how the human body feels some bugs running on it skin.\nSeveral study notes were successfully recovered and transferred back to our facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Prioritize the recovery of additional data from the control panel to gain further insights into the nature of this reality and the events that transpired here.\nTechnology Acquisition: Studying restored study notes could unlock new research projects.</text>

						<text>Breakthrough in Research\n\nAbstract:\nA research team delved into the depths of a flesh-infested facility, uncovering disturbing experiments conducted by a rogue scientist. The facility served as a hub for fleshmass research, with experiments ranging from organ mutation to mind control of fleshbeasts. The recovered data offers valuable insights into the potential applications and dangers of flesh mass technology.\n\nDiary #3:\nResearcher [REDACTED]\n[**.**.****] I found a solution to the problem. I can incubate a fleshmass tumor from a cyst in a Subject, allowing for the mutation of new organs with even stronger effects. Pity that I need to request a new Subject for it each time, though.\n[**.**.****] Today I was able to connect the brain tissue of a new Subject to a Fingerspike, allowing them to command it. To my surprise, it almost went out of control, when Subject was able to control unrelated Fingerspikes locked in a different room. This phenomenon requires more testing.\n[**.**.****] I tried to combine multiple Fingerspikes into one, and the result went beyond my expectations. The resulting creature was able to execute commands, that normal Fingerspikes didn't even understand.\n\nDiary #5:\nResearcher [REDACTED]\n[**.**.****] They forbid me from mutating myself. They afraid I'll loose my brilliant mind. But they're wrong! It will only help me understand the fleshmass better. They will understand, once I'm done.\n[**.**.****] This pain! Why so much pain? But I can't stop here and now.\n[**.**.****] This pain... is not my pain... The tumors still hold some of the person's mind within them. Their anger. It's not my pain! I need more, so I can control them!\n[**.**.****] Finally, it's under my control. Their feelings are no longer in control. Now I can feel every single fleshbeast in the facility and command them. But I shouldn't tell them yet. They're still not ready to accept it.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe underground facility appears to have been a major hub for fleshmass research and experimentation.\nThe extensive network of underground structures suggests a significant investment in this field.\nHowever, the facility has become compromised by the very substance it sought to study.\nSeveral study notes were successfully recovered and transferred back to our facility.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Prioritize the recovery of additional data from the terminal to gain a comprehensive understanding of the facility's last moments.\nTechnology Acquisition: Studying restored study notes could unlock new research projects.</text>

						<text>Containment Breach\n\nAbstract:\nA team of researchers ventured into a flesh-infested facility, uncovering a disturbing experiment in human augmentation and flesh mass control. The facility's rogue scientist had developed the ability to manipulate and merge with the flesh mass, posing a significant threat to the facility and potentially the entire planet. The team must neutralize the threat by initiating a reactor meltdown, a desperate measure that will require sacrifice.\n\nDiary #19:\nResearcher [REDACTED]\n[**.**.****] Now I'm in full control of my body. They were so afraid of my progress towards a new step in human evolution. I will help them become something new. Then they will understand.\n\nSystem Recording of Containment Breach #*****:\n[**:**] Fleshmass beasts have left containment and are gathering at the Lab of [REDACTED].\n[**:**] Fleshmass beasts are starting to merge into a single organism-like structure. [REDACTED] was consumed by one of its walls.\n[**:**] Containment measures on the Lab floor have failed.\n[**:**] Containment measures on floors *** to *** have failed.\n[**:**] Preparing for reactor meltdown by the command of Chief Researcher [REDACTED].\n[**:**] Please input the command password...\n[**:**] Please input the command password...\n[**:**] Containment measures in the Reactor room have failed.\n\nObservations:\nA partially completed password input was discovered on the terminal.\nUpon consulting with our Chief Researcher [REDACTED], the correct password was obtained.\nPassword was successfully accepted.\nThe terminal revealed a disabled automatic meltdown system, due to obstruction in the reactor room, requiring manual activation.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe unlocked manual override function presents an opportunity to vaporize the facility and the surrounding area, potentially containing the flesh mass infestation. However, this requires a sacrifice, as someone must remain behind to initiate and control the process. A priority should be given to evacuating personnel through the Blood Lake exit before activation.\nSeveral study notes were successfully recovered and transferred back to our facility.\n\n[High Level Access Required]:\nA review of the recovered study notes suggests a more dire situation. The flesh mass may have already spread across the planet, making local containment efforts futile. We was lucky to find out about such scenario on other's mistakes. There is a high chance that eventually Fleshmass will find it way through Blood Lake to our reality. This elevate the threat level to higher than even Class-4, potentially causing our planet being consumed as well.\nDestruction of this area will just clear local fleshmass, which will be infested after some time again, due to the planet scale infestation.\n\nRecommendations:\nSacrificial Mission: A volunteer should be selected to initiate the manual meltdown, ensuring the containment of the flesh mass within this reality.\nTechnology Acquisition: Studying restored study notes could unlock new research projects.</text>

						<text>Emiting Frigid Air\n\nSubject: {PAWN_nameDef}\n\nAbstract:\nThis report documents an anomalous tree emitting frigid air, causing a significant temperature drop within the containment room. The discovery of a hidden passage emanating from the tree necessitates a reclassification to Class-1 (Caution). Further research, including a manned expedition through the passage, is recommended.\n\nObservations:\nSensors within the containment room detected a rapid decrease in temperature.\n{PAWN_nameDef} was instructed to analyze the snow present on the tree and to install sensors to select branches.\nA hidden passage was subsequently discovered behind the tree's branches.\n\nOutcome:\nSensor readings confirmed that the tree's needles were emitting frigid air, registering temperatures as low as -20 degrees Celsius.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe emission of frigid air from the tree's needles likely accounts for the persistent presence of snow on the tree, even under high temperatures outside.\nThe presence of a hidden passage emanating from the tree suggests the existence of an unexplored location beyond it.\nThe potential size of this location may exceed the tree's physical dimensions, exhibiting spatial anomalies similar to those previously observed in the stockings.\nGiven the potential risk of hypothermia, the tree has been reclassified as Class-1 (Caution) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nStudy: Continued research on the tree's anomalous properties is crucial.\nExpedition: A manned expedition should be organized to investigate the location accessible through the hidden passage.\nControlled Use: The tree's capacity to generate frigid air should be explored for potential applications as a controlled cooling source.</text>

						<text>Giant Tree\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nThis report documents the anomalous extraction of a large tree from within a seemingly conventional Christmas stockings. The extraction process resulted in the destruction of the stockings. The retrieved tree exhibited rapid and anomalous root growth despite relocation attempts. Given the absence of hostile behavior, the tree has been classified as Class-0 (Safe) and is now the primary focus of ongoing anomalous research.\n\nObservations:\nTo retrieve the final gift, a winch was employed to pull it from within the stockings.\nThe extraction process was time-consuming, but a portion of the gift eventually became visible.\nThe visible portion revealed a whole tree, significantly larger, than the containing it stockings.\nSubject was instructed to continue the extraction operation.\nWith the application of additional force, the tree was successfully extracted, resulting in the complete destruction of the stockings.\n\nOutcome:\nThe stockings were torn apart, losing all observed anomalous properties.\nThe retrieved tree exceeded both the dimensions of the stockings and the size of most trees within the facility territory.\nThroughout the extraction and subsequent examination, the tree displayed no hostile behavior.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe stockings appear to have lacked sufficient elasticity to accommodate the size of the contained object. As a result, the fabric ruptured, expelling the object within. Analysis of the remaining fabric fragments revealed no anomalous properties.\nSurface analysis indicated a design resembling a Christmas tree decorated with toys and snow. Despite relocation attempts, the tree consistently demonstrates rapid and anomalous root growth into the ground.\nThe retrieved tree has become the primary focus of this anomalous research.\nGiven the absence of hostile behavior, the tree has been temporary classified as Class-0 (Safe) anomaly.\n\nRecommendations:\nContinued research on the retrieved tree is necessary to further investigate its anomalous properties and explore potential applications.</text>

						<text>Celebration on the Other Side\n\nAbstract:\nThis report documents the successful exploration of a passage located under the tree. The passage led to an expansive ice plain, where multiple boxes and animated snowmen were observed. The low ambient temperature presents a significant risk of the passage becoming impassable. Recommendations include the examination of the boxes, retrieval of valuable items, and the establishment of a defensive perimeter due to the potential for hostile encounters.\n\nObservations:\nAn exploration team, consisting of [REDACTED], entered a passage located under the tree.\nFollowing a brief period of travel through a dark, wooden-walled tunnel, the team reached an ice field.\nThe exit tree closely resembled the entry tree.\nMultiple boxes of varying colors were observed in the vicinity of the tree exit, along with the presence of numerous snowmen.\nSome team members reported observing movement among the snowmen.\n\nOutcome:\nThe exploration team successfully traversed the passage under the tree and reached the destination.\nSensor data indicates that the ice plain is largely devoid of significant features, with the exception of a small area surrounding the tree exit.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe desolate nature of the ice plain suggests limited exploration potential beyond the immediate vicinity of the tree exit.\nThe low ambient temperature presents a significant concern, with a high probability of the passage becoming impassable due to freezing within few days. All operations within this area should therefore be conducted with urgency.\n\nRecommendations:\nCollection: The contents of the boxes should be examined, and any valuable items should be retrieved.\nSecurity: The establishment of a defensive perimeter around the tree exit is crucial, with preparations for potential hostile encounters.</text>

						<text>Theory Regarding Christmas Tree\n\nSubject: [REDACTED]\n\nAbstract:\nThis report documents the temporary obstruction of a passage beneath tree due to ice and encroaching branches. Analysis suggests the passage may become accessible around the next new year date. The tree's classification remains Class-1 (Caution). A hypothesis suggests the tree facilitates annual access to a celebration, with participants undergoing a trial before receiving gifts. Continued visits to this location during future celebration period is recommended.\n\n\nObservations:\nSensor data indicated that the passage under the tree had become obstructed by ice and encroaching branches.\nAttempts to remove the ice and branches were unsuccessful.\n\nOutcome:\nAnalysis of the ice formation suggests a potential melting around the next new year date.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe passage under the tree currently appears impassable. However, based on ice analysis, a reopening of the passage may be feasible around the next new year date.\nGiven the collected data on this tree, its current classification as a Class-1 (Caution) anomaly remains unchanged.\n\nHypothesis:\n[REDACTED] has proposed a theory suggesting that the stockings served as an invitation to a celebration. While the tree itself may function as a means of transportation to this celebration. Participants of this celebration may undergo a trial administered by the surrounding snowman guards. Successful completion of this trial grants access to gifts left for the participants. The purpose and motivations behind this generosity remain unknown. Since the celebration occurs annually, the means of transportation likely remains with the participants in deactivated state between celebration.\n\nRecommendations:\nControlled Use: Continued visits to this location during future celebration periods are recommended to utilize the provided gifts for the benefit of this facility.</text>
