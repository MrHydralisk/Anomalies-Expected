# Anomalies Expected

![Text](/Mod%20Page/Images/Anomalies%20Expected.png)

If you want more anomalies to explore and experiment with, then you might like this mod.

## Mod Contents

Mod adding new anomalies for Anomaly DLC. With it own benefits and risks.
Most anomalies here give you some benefit for keeping them in colony with it own containment risks, rather than being just a temporary threat event to the colony like most of anomalies from DLC.
While usually I try to explain in mod description how mod content work in details, due to the main interest of anomalies is to discover and study them, I won't spoil it.
On some study notes label and description of anomaly might change to fit the current understanding of the anomaly.

Currently available:
* 1 Anomaly of basic category
* 1 Anomaly of advanced category

### Ordinary Bed

*Your colonist noticed some object falling from the sky nearby. At close inspection it seems like an ordinary bed, but with frame made of organic metal. It looks very comfortable to sleep on.*

### Ordinary Hospital Bed

*Your colonist noticed some object falling from the sky nearby. At close inspection it seems like an ordinary bed specially designed for use in hospitals, but with frame made of organic metal. Medical clipboard lying on the bed with some text written on it.*

More anomalies in development and will be added, when ready.

## Mod Compatibility

**While Anomalies Expected made for Anomaly DLC, it include non-anomaly patch, which will cut DLC only parts like process of anomaly studying and related to it notes, if DLC not available. But will still allow you to recieve some of the content from this mod.**

Should have no compatibility issues with other mods.
